                    <p>A Free Bird is a 501(c) 3 non-profit arts education organization dedicated to helping young people. ages 4-18, affected by cancer, fight their disease through the therapeutic benefits of the arts. We provide the resources to hospitals and their patients so these kids can express their ideas and passions, while they go through their treatments. We have three main programs: DREAM,which introduces the child to all art forms; FIGHT FREE, &nbsp;which matches the child with an art tutor for 12 weeks, and FREE, in which the child experiences a red carpet day to showcase their artwork.</p>
